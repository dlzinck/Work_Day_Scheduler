# Work_Day_Scheduler

## Description
This application is a Work Day Scheduler that allows one to save events, reset the board, and see the current time allowing them to bring a little more order to their busy lives. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I have also implemented a clock with moment.js that works locally and updates on screen. This application was a homework assignment from University of Arizona full-stack boot camp.
